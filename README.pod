=head1 NAME

Physics::Photoemission

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Physics::Photoemission;
 my $model = Physics::Photoemission->new;
 $model->simulate;
 $model->process;
 print $model->report;

or

 perl -MPhysics::Photoemission -E 'run_sim'

same as above.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module models the initial longitudinal distribution of electrons photogenerated by a gaussian laser pulse. These parameters are of the form to be used as the initial conditions of the AG model first presented by Michalik and Sipe (J. App. Phys. [vol] [page]).

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTION

=head2 run_sim( [ %opts | $opts_hashref ] )

Exported as a shortcut to run a basic simulation from the command line. See C<SYNOPSIS> for the description of the steps taken. Any parameters passed to C<run_sim()> are passed directly to the constructor C<new()>.
